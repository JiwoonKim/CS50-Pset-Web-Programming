## Pset6: Similarities
> Solved similarities(the more???? comfortable version) in June, 2018.

- hello: 
  > first program in C, getting to know how to compile(using the make utility configured by CS50) and execute a .c file.
  
- mario: a program that prints out a full-pyramid of a specified height given by user.
    - the less comfortable version: print out a half-pyramid.
    
  > learned how to use conditions and loops
  > helped get familiar with using standard I/O (using CS50's training wheels: get_int()).
  
- cash: a program that calculates the minimum number of coins required to give a user change.
  > learned how to implement a greedy algorithm and how to handle the inherent imprecision of floating-point values.
  
- credit: a program that determines whether a provided credit card number is valid according to Luhn’s algorithm (If valid, print the which company it belongs to:American Express, MasterCard, or Visa).
  > learned how to use various math functions and operators to interact with numeral values.

## Pset7: Finance
